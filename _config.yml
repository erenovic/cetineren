          Flexible-Rate Bidirectional Video Compression with Motion Refinement
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Built a learned hierarchical bidirectional video compression model that utilizes 
          motion predictions and allows achievement of multiple rate-distortion tradeoffs 
          using single motion compression network with varying intra-frame coding networks.

          This is a slightly different re-implementation of the work by Cui et al. (2021). 
          For further detail about the model structure and how multiple rate-distortion 
          trade-offs are achieved using single model, please refer to the paper. Upto my knowledge, 
          this is the first unofficial re-implementation of this wonderful work.

          Research interests of Professor Tekalp captures a wide range of image/video processing 
          applications including image/video super resolution, compression and restoration. With 
          his vast research experience, Professor Tekalp helped me broaden my knowledge on above 
          mentioned tasks and guided me through our research.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my undergraduate research, I have worked on image and video compression using 
          recurrent and fully convolutional variational auto-encoders. My projects included our 
          work on the design of a novel bidirectional frame compression network and several 
          implementation of recent works in the literature using PyTorch machine learning 
          framework.

          During my time at Koç University Summer Research Program (KUSRP), I studied style 
          transfer and image manipulation with generative adversarial networks. Worked on 
          implementation of “Swapping Autoencoder for Deep Image Manipulation” by Park et al. 
          (2020).
