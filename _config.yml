          During my undergraduate research, I have worked on image and video compression using recurrent and fully convolutional variational 
          auto-encoders. My projects included our work on the design of a novel bidirectional frame compression network and 
          several implementation of recent works in the literature using PyTorch machine learning framework.

          During my time at Koç University Summer Research Program (KUSRP), I studied style transfer and image manipulation with generative
          adversarial networks. Worked on implementation of “Swapping Autoencoder for Deep Image Manipulation” by Park et al. (2020).

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
